# L3DTS-Web_Design-19039
This is the website I made for DTS/ECB Toastmasters.
This website was made with USBWebserver, but everything within the "root" folder is my own work.
Everything can be found by running "**usbwebserver.exe**"

#

**Root dir** - takes you to the directory all of my files are stored in. These are the files I coded up for the website.
 
**Localhost** - takes you to the homepage of the website itself. The website won't load otherwise without clicking on Localhost.
 
**PHPMyAdmin** - takes you to the database of the website. The credentials for the database remain unchanged and they are displayed on the screen (root, usbw).

#

In the ecb toastmasters database, there are 2 tables. One of them is "contact", which is the table messages from the contact form get sent to. The other table is "users", which is a list of logins that can be used to log into the website.

To log in on the website itself, both the username and password are "admin". Very secure, ik. 

Works on both Windows 10 and Windows 11
